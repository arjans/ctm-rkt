"Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming" modernized
=======
While readers often hold *Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming* (CTM) in extremely high regard for unique approach to studying computing, the *Mozart Oz* programming language arguably stands as an obstacle to a wide range of people interested in the text.

This repository represents an attempt to modernize the text by translating its code to Racket Scheme. Racket offers a simple but flexible multi-paradigm language best suited in my view to replace Oz as the vehicle conveying concepts of CTM.

Packaged in this repository are a set of reading notes of mine organized by chapter.
